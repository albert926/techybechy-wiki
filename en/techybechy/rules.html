<h1>📘 Techy Bechy Code of Conduct &amp; Server Rules</h1>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Techy Bechy</strong>.<br>This server is built for creativity, competition, and long-term worlds. We allow freedom, conflict, and chaos, but <strong>never at the cost of the community itself</strong>.</p>
<p>Play smart. Play fair. Play like you want the server to still exist tomorrow.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🧭 Server Philosophy</h2>
<p>Techy Bechy runs a <strong>semi-anarchy SMP</strong> model:</p>
<p>You <strong>can</strong> kill, steal, raid, and trap</p>
<p>You <strong>cannot</strong> ruin the experience for others out of spite</p>
<p>Skill, strategy, and social dynamics matter more than raw destruction</p>
<p>This is not a “safe SMP”, and it is not a lawless wasteland either.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Freedom exists here, but so does responsibility.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>⚔️ PvP, Raiding &amp; Combat</h2>
<h3>✔️ Allowed</h3>
<p>PvP at any time</p>
<p>Raiding bases</p>
<p>Stealing items</p>
<p>Traps, ambushes, and deception</p>
<p>Wars, rivalries, and factions (formal or informal)</p>
<h3>❌ Not Allowed</h3>
<p>Spawn killing or repeated targeting of one player to harass them</p>
<p>Using exploits, hacked clients, or automation to gain unfair combat advantages</p>
<p>Combat logging to avoid death or consequences</p>
<p>PvP is part of the game. <strong>Harassment is not.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>🏠 Bases, Builds &amp; Griefing</h2>
<p>This is the most important rule on the server.</p>
<h3>✔️ Allowed</h3>
<p>Raiding bases for loot</p>
<p>Breaking blocks <strong>necessary</strong> to access loot</p>
<p>Tactical destruction with a clear purpose</p>
<h3>❌ Not Allowed</h3>
<p>Griefing just to destroy</p>
<p>Lava casting bases after raiding</p>
<p>TNT-spamming or flattening builds out of spite</p>
<p>Destroying farms, redstone, or storage without intent to use or steal</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You may <strong>raid a base</strong>.<br>You may <strong>not erase someone’s work for fun</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the goal is destruction rather than gameplay, it crosses the line.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🧠 Locator Bar &amp; Stealth</h2>
<p>The <strong>Locator Bar is enabled</strong></p>
<p>This helps keep PvP active and the server alive</p>
<p>Hiding is still possible using mechanics (e.g. wither skulls, terrain, movement)</p>
<p>This is a <strong>design choice</strong>, not a bug. Adapt and play smart.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🛠 Exploits, Cheating &amp; Automation</h2>
<h3>❌ Strictly Forbidden</h3>
<p>Hacked clients</p>
<p>X-ray (resource packs or mods)</p>
<p>Auto-clickers</p>
<p>Duplication glitches</p>
<p>Bug abuse for personal gain</p>
<p>If something feels like it wasn’t intended, <strong>don’t use it</strong>.<br>Ask staff if you’re unsure.</p>
<hr>
<h2>💬 Chat &amp; Community Conduct</h2>
<p>Techy Bechy is competitive, but not toxic.</p>
<h3>❌ Not Allowed</h3>
<p>Hate speech or slurs</p>
<p>Threats (real-world or in-game)</p>
<p>Excessive harassment or bullying</p>
<p>Spam or advertising without permission</p>
<p>Trash talk is fine.<br>Crossing into personal attacks is not.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🧑‍⚖️ Staff Decisions &amp; Enforcement</h2>
<p>Staff decisions are <strong>final</strong></p>
<p>Punishments scale with intent and history</p>
<p>Arguing in public chat about moderation will not help your case</p>
<p>If you believe a mistake was made, <strong>appeal calmly and privately</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>📌 Final Rule (Read This)</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If your actions make others want to quit the server, you’ve gone too far.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Techy Bechy is meant to be dangerous, exciting, and memorable.<br>Not empty.</p>
<p>Play smart. Build cool things. Break things with purpose.<br>Welcome to <strong>Techy Bechy</strong> 🧱⚙️</p>
