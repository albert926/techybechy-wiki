<h3>Welcome to the official <strong>Albert Talks Tech Wiki</strong></h3>
<p>This wiki is where I keep everything related to the services I host. You’ll find setup guides, instructions, tutorials, and random but useful info that I don’t want to forget later (no, I can't make coffe for you).</p>
<p>A lot of time and effort went into putting this together, so I hope you find it helpful and easy to use. If you’re looking for how something works or how to set something up, this is probably the right place.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
